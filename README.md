First part: Protein sequence and structure database creation
  1. Parsing PDB, PDBsum and PISCES original files.
  2. Extract corresponding DNA sequence using TBLASTN, clean and match the results to PDB format files.
  3. Tessellated protein structure in 3-dimension.
  4. Create SQL databases for further analysis.

Second part: Protein sequence, secondary and tertiary structure analysis
  1. Statistical analysis on tessellated results including calculate the log-likelihood ratio for each simplex and perform hypothesis tests.
  2. Secondary structure classification, clustering and assignment using machine learning algorithms and deep learning.
  3. Codon level protein-protein interfaces analysis, try to find relationship between mutagenesis and log-likelihood potential on structure levels.
